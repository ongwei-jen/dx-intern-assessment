1. What is Github?

Github is an online platform that stores or hosts repositories using a web-based graphical 
user interface. It allows for people anywhere around the world to collaborate on projects at
the same time. By using branches, the process can be simplified as collaborators can work on 
certain files then merge them with the entirety of the project when they are done. Changes 
that are applicable to everyone involved in the project can also be made easier by having 
changes in the master branch.

2. How does Github help developers?

Github simplifies collaborative work. In the developement of software (maybe and app or website),
many people are working on a single project. Github allows for multiple users to work effectively
on the same project as users are able to clone repositories where they can save a copy for 
themselves to work on. The users can then merge them back to the original file folder. 

Github also has notifications of when users changed something in the codes, down to the details 
of which line of code and at what date. It allows for easy tracking of when something was changed
and has version control in which developers can create a history of changes that can be implemented 
over time in their code. 

Developers can also be located at different parts of the world yet still be able to contribute to
their project as they can just update the master branch in the repository and other developers can 
see it. 

Github has good security that helps safeguard projects from those not involved with the work by 
having a private function that only allows the project to only be visible to those who were sent it.
