Frontend:
for the frontend, I used html and css to code the website. html and css are the standard in which website are coded in and i'm also familiar with this method. html and 
css gives much flexibilty in determining the visual outcome of the site as all aspects can be tweaked, from the padding to the placement of each individual form field down
to the pixels.

Backend:
for the backend, I used a coded a php file using sublime. i used this way because in order to have a full running reservation system, the front end has to be connected to the
database, and the php backend allows for that. it's relatively easy to code from the ground up and it can also be tweaked quite much, by implementing encryptions for passwords
or implementing logic like if-else statements. 

Database:
for the database, i downloaded XAMPP and used the phpMyAdmin database. i've used it before and could pick up again quite fast. its not a very complicated database to set up and
use. besides using the database, XAMPP also provides a server to run the form through the localhost.
